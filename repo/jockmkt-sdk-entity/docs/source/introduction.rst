Introduction
============

``jockmkt-sdk`` was developed with the intention of making it easy to interact with Jock MKT's API. Every API call has been included. This package should make placing orders, looking at historical data, and reviewing performance much easier.

Motivation
**********

Hopefully, this package makes it easier for developers and newbies to interact with the API and trade electronically.

Limitations
***********

The final user must have some understanding of the API, and its limitations in order to use this package successfully. The developer has included notes and ideas to help deal with these limitations successfully.
