    How it works:

    Once an event has started, we are looking for players who far outperform their projections early on. These players are
    likely to fall back down to earth at some point before the event ends.
    For example, in an NFL Sunday slate, if Saquon Barkley gets a 50 yard touchdown in the first 2 minutes of his 1pm game,
    he will be projected for many more points than anyone else. Because of this, his price will be very inflated.
    We should short him! This strategy is also applicable to NBA, and other sports, where a player scores a large chunk of
    points early on in the event.
